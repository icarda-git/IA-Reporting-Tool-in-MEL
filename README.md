# MEL IA eReporting tool
 
The IA eReporting tool is a part of Monitoring, Evaluation and Learning (MEL) which is multi-center and multi-CRP online platform for integrated management, monitoring, and reporting of projects, from planning to budgeting, risks' assessment, knowledge sharing and more.

The tool is using other MEL modules, libraries and plugins to support its functionality.

[Zend framework 1](https://framework.zend.com/manual/1.12/en/manual.html) is the core of MEL which provide an MVC interface and provide different solutions to facilitate and secure the tool.

The tool depends also on MEL modules like the users, partners, countries, cities, Excel exports and PDF exports. It also uses plugins such as PHPExcel, MPDF, Bootstrap, JQuery, Select2, DataTables, Selectize and DatePicker.

> NOTE: This repository contains a partial code from [MEL](https://github.com/icarda-git/MEL) related to the IA reporting tool and doesn't contain dependencies (i.e. other modules or plugins). In order to have the tool working all other dependencies should be included, a fully working version could be found in https://github.com/icarda-git/MEL
